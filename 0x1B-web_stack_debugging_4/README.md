0x1B. Web Stack Debugging #4
This folder contains solutions for the web stack debugging task #4. The primary goal is to troubleshoot and resolve issues related to a web server setup featuring Nginx under high pressure conditions. The task involves using ApacheBench to simulate HTTP requests and identifying and fixing the causes of failed requests.

Puppet Lint Installation
Before diving into debugging, make sure to install Puppet Lint using the following commands:

bash
Copy code
$ apt-get install -y ruby
$ gem install puppet-lint -v 2.1.1
Debugging Process
Identify the Problem:

Understand the nature of the issue causing a high number of failed requests during the benchmarking process.
Analyze Logs:

Check server logs (e.g., Nginx logs) to identify any error messages or patterns that indicate the cause of failures.
Review Configuration Files:

Examine relevant configuration files, such as Nginx configuration, to ensure settings are appropriate for handling the given load.
Optimize Server Configuration:

Adjust server configurations based on the analysis of logs and benchmark results.
Optimize settings for performance, concurrency, and resource utilization.
Retest with ApacheBench:

After making changes, re-run the ApacheBench test to verify improvements and ensure that the number of failed requests approaches zero.
Documentation:

Update documentation with any changes made to the server configurations or any insights gained during the debugging process.
Remember that logs are valuable tools for understanding issues, and a systematic approach to debugging is crucial. It's essential to monitor server resources, identify bottlenecks, and adjust configurations accordingly.

Benchmarking with ApacheBench:
To simulate HTTP requests using ApacheBench, use a command similar to the following:

bash
Copy code
ab -n 2000 -c 100 http://your_server_address
Replace your_server_address with the actual address of your server.
