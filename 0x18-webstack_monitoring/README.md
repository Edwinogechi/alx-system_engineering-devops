0x18-Web Monitoring Project
Overview
The Web Monitoring Project aims to provide real-time insights into the health and performance of web services and applications. This monitoring system enables users to track various metrics, detect anomalies, and ensure optimal functionality.

Features
Real-time Metrics: Monitor key metrics such as response time, latency, and server uptime to ensure a seamless user experience.

Alerts and Notifications: Receive alerts and notifications via email or other channels when predefined thresholds are breached, allowing for proactive issue resolution.

Historical Data Analysis: Access historical data to analyze trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions for future optimizations.

User-Friendly Dashboard: Visualize data through an intuitive and customizable dashboard, providing a comprehensive overview of the web infrastructure's status.

Scalability: Easily scale the monitoring system to accommodate growing web applications and services.

Tools and Technologies
Prometheus: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability.

Grafana: A powerful open-source platform for monitoring and observability with a rich set of data visualization options.

Alertmanager: Coordinates alerts sent by Prometheus servers to various notification platforms.

Exporter Libraries: Use exporters to collect and export metrics from third-party systems and services.

Getting Started
Installation:

Install and configure Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager on your server or container orchestration platform.
Configuration:
